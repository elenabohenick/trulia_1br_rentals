# Project Problem

New York has more than 3.5 million apartments in the housing stock. Sixty percent of those are rentals! This project is focusing on one-bedroom apartments in five-boroughs of New York and identifies what factors dictate the rent price. I decided to do analysis on one-bedroom only in order to eliminate the most obvious predictor: number of bedrooms and explore other features contributing to price of rent.
