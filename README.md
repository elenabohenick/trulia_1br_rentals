# Project Goal

New York has more than 3.5 million apartments in the housing stock. Sixty percent of those are rentals! This project is focusing on one-bedroom apartments in five-boroughs of New York and identifies what factors dictate the rent price. I decided to do analysis on one-bedroom only in order to eliminate the most obvious predictor: number of bedrooms and explore other features contributing to price of rent. 


### Data:
1. Trulia one-bedroom features.  

⋅⋅⋅First, I used *BeatifulSoup* to get individual URLs for one bedroom appartments in New York. Then I collected appartment features using *Scrapy*. Below is an example from appartment features that I collected.⋅⋅
